# encryptingMessage in Java
Simple Java program to encrypt a custom message with a randomized key. Even though the message is decryptable as long as the key is know through a scrambler it is not the best practice. Example of a symetric encryption technique without decrypting method. Length of message does not matter since encryption is handeled through a loop.
