# encryptingMessage in Java
Simple Java program to encrypt a custom message with a randomized key. The message is decryptable as long as the key is know, but a scrambler is making that process harder and is not the best practice. 
Example of a symetric encryption technique without decrypting method. Length of message does not matter since encryption is handeled through a loop.
